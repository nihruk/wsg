<h2 class="heading-underline">Why squash</h2>
<p>
    Git is a tool to keep track of the historical changes to a codebase. We want each change to be atomic
    (self-contained). This makes it easy to find changes, as well as roll them back. The idea is that before and after
    each commit, the repository is in a stable state.
</p>
<p>
    When developing, we do not directly produce these atomic changes. Instead, we tend to commit any number of changes,
    some of which undo earlier changes. This is a normal way of working.
</p>
<p>
    Squashing lets us clean up this development/working history, consisting of multiple separate commits, the sum of
    which represents an atomic change, into a single commit. This single commit is then ready to be merged into
    <code>main</code>.
</p>
<p>
    This approach gets us the best of both worlds: we can develop changes the way we want to, save when we need to, yet
    the end result is clean and self-documenting.
</p>
<h2 class="heading-underline">How to squash</h2>
<p>
    When performing a squash, the simplest and most common situation is when you are on your own branch, with
    <code>n</code> commits (<code>n</code> being a number greater than or equal to 2), of which the most recent commit
    is the branchâ€™s <code>HEAD</code>. <code>n</code> represents the number of commits to squash into one.
</p>
<p>
    Run <code>git rebase -i HEAD~n</code>. For a squash of the 3 most recent commits (<code>n</code> is 3), this would
    be <code>git rebase -i HEAD~3</code>.
</p>
<p>
    Git will open your default editor for the first time. You will see all 3 commits listed, prefixed with
    <code>pick</code>:
</p>
<pre class="code p-1"><code>pick a1b2c3 B
pick d4e5f6 C
pick g7h8i9 D
</code></pre>
<p>
    In this example, commit D (<code>g7h8i9</code>) is the most recent commit (<code>HEAD</code>).
</p>
<p>
    Because a squash squashes the newest <code>n</code>-1 commits into the <code>n</code>th commit, change
    <code>pick</code> to <code>squash</code> for the <strong>newest</strong> 2 commits. In your editor, these are the
    <strong>last</strong> 2 commits, as they are listed oldest first:
</p>
<pre class="code p-1"><code>pick a1b2c3 B
squash d4e5f6 C
squash g7h8i9 D
</code></pre>
<p>
    Save and exit your editor.
</p>
<p>
    Git will then open your default editor for the second time. This is where you edit the message for the new, single,
    squashed commit. Note that Git prepopulated this with the 3 messages from the original commits. Edit and comment out
    as appropriate, save, and exit your editor.
</p>
<p>
    The squash is now done. Run <code>git log</code> for confirmation.
</p>
<h2 class="heading-underline">Why rebase</h2>
<p>
    Most of the time we rebase PR branches in order to pull in the changes from <code>main</code>. Given the following
    commit history on <code>main</code>:
</p>
<pre class="code p-1"><code>A -&gt; B -&gt; C</code></pre>
<p>
    and the following commit history on <code>pr</code>:
</p>
<pre class="code p-1"><code>A -&gt; B -&gt; D</code></pre>
<p>
    we want to update <code>pr</code> to look like:
</p>
<pre class="code p-1"><code>A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D</code></pre>
<p>
    This way, <code>pr</code> looks exactly like <code>main</code> would look like after the PR has been merged. This
    allows us to review (manually and through automated tests) the changes in their future final state, without risk of
    our changes being in the wrong order, like with a plain merge.
</p>
<h2 class="heading-underline">How to rebase</h2>
<p>
    Given the branches from <i>Why rebase</i>, run the following:
</p>
<pre class="code p-1"><code>git checkout pr
git rebase main
</code></pre>
<p>
    Git may report that there are merge conflicts. Resolve these, and run:
</p>
<pre class="code p-1"><code>git add -A .
git rebase --continue
</code></pre>
<p>
    Git may report merge conflicts iteratively, for as many times as there are commits on <code>pr</code> that do not
    exist on <code>main</code> (up to <code>n</code> times).
</p>
<p>
    The rebase is now done. Run <code>git log</code> for confirmation.
</p>
<p>
    You may exit an ongoing rebase at any time using <code>git rebase --abort</code>.
</p>
<h2 class="heading-underline">Why squash before rebase</h2>
<p>
    As we saw in <i>How to rebase</i>, the number of conflicts grows with the number of commits on the target branch
    (<code>pr</code>) that do not exist on the base branch (<code>main</code>). Squashing the commits on a target branch
    before rebasing means that there will be at most a single iteration of conflicts for you to resolve, rather than
    potentially <code>n</code>.
</p>
<p>
    Given the following commit history on <code>main</code>:
</p>
<pre class="code p-1"><code>A -&gt; B -&gt; C</code></pre>
<p>
    and the following commit history on <code>pr</code>:
</p>
<pre class="code p-1"><code>A -&gt; B -&gt; D -&gt; E</code></pre>
<p>
    If commits <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, and <code>E</code> all make changes to the same few lines of code,
    <code>C</code> will conflict with both <code>D</code> and <code>E</code>, resulting in two iterations of conflicts
    for you to resolve during a rebase.
</p>
<p>
    Considering there are no conflicts when squashing, performing a squash before a rebase gives the following commit
    history on <code>main</code>:
</p>
<pre class="code p-1"><code>A -&gt; B -&gt; C</code></pre>
<p>
    and the following commit history on <code>pr</code>:
</p>
<pre class="code p-1"><code>A -&gt; B -&gt; F</code></pre>
<p>
    where <code>F</code> is the single commit resulting from the squash of <code>D</code> and <code>E</code>, which
    means that <code>C</code> only conflicts with <code>F</code> and the following rebase will only require you to
    resolve that single conflict.
</p>
